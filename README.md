# Scuffed Mario game

This game is a spin on the Mario franchise (maybe?).
You control an old Nokia 3310 and try to jump over pipes.

The recomended way of interacting with the game and fully immerse yourself is by throwing your phone straight up in the air to make your ingame phone jump (Make sure to catch it though!).

If you feel like cheating you could also just not let go of your phone when you're performing the throwing motion, but where's the fun in that.
