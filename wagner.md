## Raphael Wagner (14/15P)

### 1 DIPPID Sender (4.5/5P)

 * accelerometer payload is enclosed in quotes, so I had to decode it manually **(-0.5)**

### 2 2D Game (9.5/10P)

 * game implementation
   * all requirements fulfilled with minimal effort
 * DIPPID input
   * works
 * code quality
   * looks good
   * it's "collision", not "colission"
 * interaction technique
   * maybe a little bit to insensitive? I can only manage to jump over the lowest target. Double sensitivity seems fine. But I just might be a noob.
 * look of the game
   * unique
 * venv
   * requirements.txt is not complete (misses pyglet) **(-0.5)**
